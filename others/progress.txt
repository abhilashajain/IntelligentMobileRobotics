NOTE : Just create a python file and complete the assignment, while submitting use the VishwakarmaS.py to follow the assignment guidlines

Assignment 4

To Launch Aster camera:

Step 1 :: roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch --screen

Step 2 :: roslaunch astra_launch astra.launch --screen

Step 3 :: rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw (change the topic according to need)
          you can also run multiple views at same time


Installations ::

# sudo apt-get install python-opencv

# sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-cv-bridge

# sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-vision-opencv

Also ROS PKG Install :: cv_bridge, vision_opencv, image_transport

watch -n1 rostopic echo /my_topic/field_name

Note : Red with aster camera is not Red I have added images

Running coursing.py

launch bringup, astra


Coding ::
opencv split rgb to b,g,r
opencv split hsv to v,s,h

so in hsv version of rgb red_circle.jpeg threshold are

for v > 60
for s > 60
for h > 60

we are able to drow circle to red in video stream

try if ther is time to do same with ir senson

Dont run a window in OpenCV Just access the topic and get the
camera data and then porcess it and send control command to publisher topic
Use the pring data to detect the boll and move robot
